# PUSH_SWAP

This program is the school 42 **push_swap** project. 

Its goal is to **sort a list of integers** with the help of two stacks (with a LIFO principle), and the following operations :
- push A or push B : pushes top element from stack B towards stack A (or vice versa)
- rotate A or rotate B : first element of stack A (or B) becomes the last one
- reverse rotate A or reverse rotate B : last element of stack A (or B) becomes the first one
- swap A or swap B : swaps the first two elements of stack A (or B).

All integers must be sorted in order (biggest one at the bottom) in **stack A** and with a minimal amount of operations.

This program allowed me to validate this project with a score of 82/100 and does not include the bonus checker.
